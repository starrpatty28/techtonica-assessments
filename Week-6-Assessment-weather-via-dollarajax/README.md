Goal: show what weather.gov returns as the current weather for SF.

Requirements:

1. Get 2 types of data using AJAX from weather.gov's API. 

  * This is the URL to use. It is for San Francisco: 
  https://api.weather.gov/gridpoints/MTR/88,126/forecast/hourly 

  * Please use jQuery's .ajax() function. (jQuery has already been included for you, 
  via a script tag in `index.html`.) The examples at the bottom of this page will help: 
  http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.ajax/ 

  * The JSON that gets returned is long, so here's a hint. Assuming I'm calling the 
  response jsonResponse, a short word like "Rain" will be returned from 
  `jsonResponse.properties.periods[0].shortForecast`. Experiment with what else you can 
  find in `jsonResponse.properties.periods[0]` and pick one other piece of data to pluck 
  out.

2. The AJAX request must carry out a function on success that adds your retrieved data to 
the html with jQuery, and and an error message to your html on error. These should appear 
in your result window when the project is run. No need to style anything.

  * To test the error message, introduce a typo into the URL string (for example). 
  
  * The error message can be anything you want; no need to reproduce the error message 
  returned from the AJAX request.

3. Create a Promise that changes the background color of your page after the AJAX request 
is complete.

  * You do not need to use the new Promise syntax. You can simply chain your 
  functionality onto the end of your existing chain.

  * This background color change should happen even if your AJAX request errored out.
