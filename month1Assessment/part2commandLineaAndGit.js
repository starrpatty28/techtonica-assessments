// Welcome to the Month 1 assessment, Part 2: Command line and git/GitHub
// For this section, please DO NOT Google or use any references.
// If you can't fully complete a question, please write down your best guess or your thoughts so far.
// Recommended time: 10 minutes

// Command Line Questions

// What’s the command to switch to another directory?

When I am in a directory I always cd ../ until I am where I want to be.For  example to get to my desktop I 'cd Desktop' to get there

// What’s the command to switch to the parent directory of the one you’re currently in?

I am taking a guess: ' /~' or '~'/'   ;

//What’s the command to list all files and directories in your current directory?

ls or -ls
// What’s the command to see what directory you’re currently in?

pwd

// Choose one of these commands and explain what it does:
// man
// mkdir 
this makes a new directory. I use it most to make folders
// cp
I honestly dont remember using this
// mv
I use this to move files to other files
// grep
I do not remember using this but my guess would be 'get repo' because I do not use this DOMMatrixReadOnly, I cant remember right now. 


// GitHub questions

// What does it mean to clone a repository?

When I am cloning a respository, I am downloading a file from that repository. For example: If I am working on a website and it has a HTML, CSS and JS file, When someone clones that repository they will download all the files pertaining to that respository.

// What is a pull request?

I cant remeber for sure by my guess would be to request to pull someone respository.

// What are some benefits of using version control (e.g. git and GitHub)?

Pros for git
 Personally I like Git because  I can do everything from the terminal using Git. I can create a new document (touch), I can create a new folder (mkdir), I can move a file (mv), I can remove a file (rm) all from using Git.
 
 Pros for GitHub
 What I like about GitHub is I am able to push projects I work on to the cloud through Git. When I work on a file like this onemptied, when done I will push to GitHub and someone can read my files. Someone can also download this file and give feedback and then I download it and read the feedback. Also, as a developer you do not necessarly have to always have frontend work so being able to show your coding work, GitHub is a great place to show your thought process on why you coded what you coded.
